## LogEntries stacktrace expander

If you log messages into logentries that contain "\n" characters (ex: one-lined stacktraces), and you're frustrated the displayed messages in the logentries view are compacted on one line, you could find this extension useful.

### Usage

While browsing your log messages, just click the arrow-down icon to expand all the compacted messages (so better for reading stacktraces!)
